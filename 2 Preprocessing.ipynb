This time, Lamichhane increased both the number of votes he obtained and the difference with the closest rival.  As per the officials, Lamichhane received 54,276 votes, which was 43,025 more than his closest rival, Jit Narayan Shrestha of the Nepali Congress (11,251 votes). Ram Prasad Neupane of the CPN-UML, third in the order, got 10,936 votes. In the November elections, Lamichhane received 49,300 votes against 14,988 votes received by Umesh Shrestha of the Nepali Congress. As the Supreme Court revoked his House membership over the citizenship legitimacy issue, Lamichhane was forced to obtain back his citizenship and prepare for the by-election.\"\n",
